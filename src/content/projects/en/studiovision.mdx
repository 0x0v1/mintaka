Mobile spyware response in civil society has high friction. This is because often, investigators do not have proximity to a device. In nearly all cases, investigations require physical device access; ephemeral memory artifacts vanish before labs receive devices, capacity is concentrated, and can be cumbersome and jeopardize chain-of-custody.

One of the most prominent reasons Android spyware research is neglected is due to the ephemeral nature of their logging system, as appose to iOS which stores logs for a much longer period of time.

Combined, the need for physical access and urgency, result in a high demand for solutions for quicker forensic investigation without proximity.

MESH removes these barriers by building a mesh VPN specifically for forensics, enabling consent-based, remote, memory-focused acquisition that communities can self-host and trust. 

It's peer-to-peer, end-to-end encrypted, and built for the global south.

We are releasing this as open-source software in December 2025, and hope that it will be adopted by the community.
